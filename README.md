# First-App-in-Compose

- To create a new project: open Android Studio, click New Project > Empty Activity > Next, enter a name for your project and then configure its settings.
- To see how your app looks, use the Preview pane.
- Composable functions are like regular functions with a few differences: functions names are capitalized, you add the @Composable annotation before the function, @Composable functions can't return anything.
- A Modifier is used to augment or decorate your composable.
